ReMesh is an editor for manifold triangle meshes. Most operations can be performed interactively through mouse-clicks on the mesh. Both low-level (edge-flip, vertex-insert, ...) and high-level (simplification, subdivision, ...) operations are supported. It has been developed to finely post-process polygon meshes coming from digitization sessions, but it can also be used to edit meshes produced differently.

ReMesh is a "citeware" software, which means that if you use it for your research projects, you should acknowledge it, and cite the following paper:

M. Attene and B. Falcidieno
"ReMESH: An Interactive Environment to Edit and Repair Triangle Meshes"
In Procs of Shape Modeling Internationl (SMI'06), IEEE C.S. Press, pp. 271-276, 2006.

Refer to this paper for details on the theory behind the methods implemented in ReMESH.

Accompanying software
---------------------

From version 2.1, ReMESH is distributed together with MeshFIX, a command-line tool
to automatically repair raw digitized polygon meshes. For further information
please look at the readme file in the MeshFix folder.

System Requirements
--------------------

*** Windows binaries ***

I run it successfully on Win 2000 Pro, XP Home, XP Pro, Vista.
I never tried it on any other version of Windows.
If your system does not include a recent development
environment, you may need to download and install
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86),
available for download at:
